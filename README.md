# Banking Client Analytics Dashboard

This project analyzes banking customers across demographics, financial behavior, loyalty tiers, risk levels, and advisor performance using Power BI, MySQL, Excel, and Python preprocessing.  
The solution helps banking teams understand client profitability, identify high-value segments, optimize advisor workloads, and strengthen customer relationship strategies.

##  Project Overview

The Banking Client Analytics Dashboard transforms raw customer data into meaningful insights across three key areas:

1. **Overview Dashboard** – Total clients, deposits, loans, income, risk levels, and credit balance  
2. **Client Demographics & Segmentation** – Age groups, fee structure, loyalty tier, nationality, and banking relationship  
3. **Investment Advisor Performance** – Deposits managed, loans handled, risk weighting, and client counts per advisor  

The goal is to help stakeholders understand where revenue is generated, which segments drive growth, and which advisors contribute most to bank performance.
